For each person I have 10 Frontal and 4 profile image:

The dataset is 10 person.
compute output of cnn which is 128 dimension for each person which is called descriptors.
for each image the cnn output is 128 dimension.

calculate distance for each person:
name of the person = 001
001_frontal
001_profile

for 2 people I have the dict composed of = {001-profile :[10 different num, each 128 vectors]}
